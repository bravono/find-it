# Find-It
Find-It is an open-source web application designed to revolutionize the rental market by directly connecting tenants and landlords, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Our goal is to create a seamless, transparent platform where finding a house or a tenant is as simple as signing up.

# Project Status: Agile Development
We're currently in our first sprint, with a focused deadline of June 12, 2025. This project is open for collaboration, and we welcome contributions from anyone interested in helping us bridge the gap between tenants and landlords!

# Tech Stack
Find-It is built using a modern and robust set of technologies to ensure scalability, performance, and a great user experience:

Next.js: Powers both the frontend user interface and the backend API, enabling a highly efficient full-stack development process.

Postman: Utilized for comprehensive API testing, ensuring all endpoints are functioning correctly and reliably.

Microsoft To Do and ClickUp: Our tool of choice for scheduling and tracking tasks, helping us manage project workflows and meet deadlines efficiently.

PostgreSQL: Serves as our primary relational database, providing robust and scalable data storage for all rental listings, user profiles, and transactions.

Vercel Blob: Used for securely storing and managing files, images, and videos, ensuring quick access to multimedia content within the application.
